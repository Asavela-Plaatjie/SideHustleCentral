        How to Get Started in Stock Photography
      </h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Selling stock photography isn’t just about uploading pictures—you need a strategy to make your images stand out.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Step 1: Understanding Market Demand
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Before submitting your photos, research popular themes and trends. Some of the highest-selling stock photography categories include:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Business and technology images</li>
        <li>Lifestyle and people</li>
        <li>Food and drink</li>
        <li>Nature and travel</li>
        <li>Wellness and health</li>
        <li>Abstract and textures</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        Review stock photography marketplaces to see what kinds of images sell best.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Step 2: Taking High-Quality Photos
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Stock sites have strict quality guidelines. Your images should be:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">High-resolution</span> (minimum 4MP, preferably more)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Properly lit</span> with balanced exposure</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Well-composed</span> with clear subject matter</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Free of noise and blur</span></li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>
        Editing software like Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop can help enhance image quality.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Step 3: Preparing Your Photos for Sale
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Once you have high-quality images, you must:
      </p>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Edit and enhance - </span>Adjust exposure, contrast, and sharpness.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Use proper file formats - </span>JPEG is the industry standard.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Write detailed descriptions - </span>Keywords and captions help buyers find your images.</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Remove logos or trademarks - </span>Stock sites prohibit branded content.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h3>
        Step 4: Uploading Photos to Stock Photography Sites
      </h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        Each stock photography website has different submission guidelines. You’ll need to:

      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Create an account</li>
        <li>Submit images for review</li>
        <li>Ensure compliance with licensing rules</li>
        <li>Set prices or accept default pricing</li>
